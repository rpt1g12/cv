I would like to inform you that I, Rafael P\'erez-Torr\'o, am resigning from my position as Test Engineer for the P3-Systems company, effective July 1, 2019.

Thank you for the support, opportunities and trust that you have provided me during the last years. I have truly enjoyed my tenure with P3-Systems, and am more than grateful for the encouragement you have given me in pursuing my professional and personal growth objectives.

If I can be of any assistance during this transition in order to facilitate the seamless passing of my responsibilities to my successor, please let me know. I would be glad to help however I can.

Yours faithfully, \newline\newline % Closing text
