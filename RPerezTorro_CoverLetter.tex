\opng{2} ``\job'' position that has recently been posted on \jobweb .\clng{2}

I am really glad to see that McLaren is advertising a role that not only fits my academic profile perfectly but it is also something that I have enjoyed doing in the past. During my MSc I was accountable for the whole CFD workflow in a project that aimed to improve the aerodynamic performance of a F1-type race car. This role combined my three big passions: Race Cars, Aerodynamics and Computers. As a computer enthusiast, I enjoy coding and developing so linking the CFD solver (STAR-CCM+) with CAD (SolidWorks) and an optimisation code (Matlab) using Java and VisualBasic scripts proved to be both challenging and rewarding at the same time.

I am also experienced in writing high quality technical reports and presenting in front of wide audiences as shown in the Publications \& Conferences section of my CV. And finally, although unfortunately I have not been able to work with it in the recent years, I also have some experience using CAD packages which you can check by visiting my linkedin profile (\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}).

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time,
if you need any more details. I look forward to your reply.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
