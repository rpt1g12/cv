%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing this letter in response to the ``Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
Engineer'' job advert on Altran's website for which I believe I have the appropriate set of skills. 

I am at the end of completing (this November) a PhD on the topic of Large-Eddy-Simulations
of wings with leading-edge modifications, and I am looking to take this further on my next
career challenge. During these last three years in the research field, not only have I
strengthened my scientific background but my also my experience in dealing with industrial
problems. During the "CFD Surgery" sessions at University of Southampton, students would
bring CFD related problems they were facing during their last year projects. It was often
the case that those projects were proposed by companies from different backgrounds. As a
consequence, this trained me to tackle many different industrial problems as if I was
working as a CFD consultant.

Additionally, as I hope you noticed in my CV, during both my MSc and Bachelors I was
involved in projects that needed both CAD and CAE tools to be applied. Specially while
designing the Solar Car in Madrid, I had to build the entire prototype's CAD model in
CatiaV5 with the necessary parametrisation in order to allow the later aerodynamic
optimisation.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me, or visit my
linkedin profile (\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt})
if you need any more details.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
