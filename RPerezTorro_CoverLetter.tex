I was excited to read about the ``\job'' position recently posted on \jobweb.
I hope that by the end of these lines you believe as strongly as I do, that I am the
right fit for the position in question due to the following reasons.

In F1 aerodynamics, managing vortical flow structures is capital. As a post-graduate
researcher at University of Southampton I have spent the past 4 years analysing in depth
flows of such nature. My work is about wings with an undulated leading edge, which I
believe have been used in the past in the rear wing section of the MP4-29 to reduce drag.
I believe that I could bring in valuable knowledge in this matter given that I have
dedicated countless hours to its investigation.

I hope you noticed in my CV that I fulfil all the necessary requirements since I used
extensively commercial CFD packages to analyse in the past and also have experience in developing CFD
codes in Fortran90 as well as post-processing tools both in Java and Python.

Finally I would like to express that although the research experience has been very
rewarding, I feel that due to my competitive character, I would much rather continue
developing my career in the fast-paced and team-based working environment of a F1 team.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time,
or visit my linkedin profile
(\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}) if you need any
more details.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
