\opng{2} ``\job'' position that has recently been posted on
\jobweb.\clng{1}

Ever since I left my home country I have been pursuing a career in aerodynamics,
especially in Computational Fluid Dynamics. My first step was to take a masters programme
that gave me the specialisation and knowledge needed to take a CFD position in industry.
During that course I gained experience in aerodynamics, turbulence, wind tunnel testing,
numerical methods and many other.

Later on I took a position at Southampton University where I have spent the last 3 years
as a researcher in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics through which I have
acquired an extensive knowledge and expertise in the matter. I have also become very
confident at writing technical reports and giving presentations in front of wide audiences
as you can seen in the Publications and Conferences section of my CV.

On top of that, researching not only has strengthened my background but also my creativity
and scientific capabilities. I am now a person that is capable of dealing with complex
problems that need imaginative and innovative solutions.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time
if you need any more details. I look forward to your reply.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
