\opng{2} ``\job'' position that has recently been posted on
\jobweb.\clng{2}

First of all, my academic history fits well with the one requested for this position. I have a total of nearly 10 years of solid academic background in fluid dynamics. Above all, I believe that my years as a post-graduate researcher in the University of Southampton have allowed me to become an expert in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. Not only I have proved to produce meaningful results that have been published in an international Journal but also to convey these to broad audiences in international conferences (see publications and awards sections on my attached CV).  

Additionally, I have plenty of experience in using industrial CFD packages in my early career projects as well providing tutorial and introductory sessions to engineering students at the University of Southampton. This could be a key asset to be considered for this position since giving customer support and conducting training courses are part of the main duties of this role.

I also consider myself a proficient programmer, specially in Python and Fortran, and a computer science enthusiast in general. I am always happy to learn new things and broaden my field of expertise so although my background comes from the aeronautical and automotive industry, working for the renewable energy and marine industries would not be a problem for me.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time
if you need any more details. I look forward to your reply.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
