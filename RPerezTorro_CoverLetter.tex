\opng{2} ``\job'' position recently posted on \jobweb.\clng{1}

Having spent the past 4 years as a researcher in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics
has given me an extensive knowledge and expertise in the matter. On top of that, researching not
only has strengthened my background but also my creativity and scientific capabilities.
As a researcher I am used to deal with problems that need imaginative and
innovative solutions.

I hope you noticed in my CV that I fulfil all the necessary requirements since I used
extensively commercial CFD packages to analyse in the past and also have experience in
developing post-processing tools both in Java and Python. Additionally, I also have
customer-service skills acquired through my experience in teaching. In particular I
believe that my experience in helping students of different backgrounds to solve their
respective CFD-related problems is really valuable to the position in question since I
basically acted as a ``CFD consultant''.

Finally, I would like to express that although the research experience has been very
rewarding, I would much rather continue developing my career in the fast-paced and
team-based working environment of a young CFD consultancy company where I would be a wide
variety of clients and projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time,
or visit my Linkedin profile (\linkedin),
if you need any more details.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
