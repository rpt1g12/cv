\opng{1} ``\job'' position that has recently been posted on \jobweb .\clng{2}

The role that \company is advertising not only fits my academic profile perfectly but it is also something that I have enjoyed doing in the past. For the past three and a half years I have been analysing the aerodynamic characteristics of wing profiles. In particular, I have been investigating the effect of leading edge shape modifications on the unsteady behaviour of a stalled wing by means of high fidelity CFD methods. However, I am also familiar with running tests on wind tunnel facilities and taking force-balance measurements. Besides, although unfortunately I have not been able to work with it in the recent years, I also have some experience using CAD packages which you can check by visiting my linkedin profile (\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}).

I am also experienced in analysing and post-processing complex 3D unsteady flows and writing high quality technical reports as shown in the Publications \& Conferences section of my CV. As a final point, although my level of French is not as good as my English or Spanish, I see this as a very exciting opportunity to increase my language skills at the same time that I gain new technical insights in other engineering fields. 

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time,
if you need further details. I look forward to your reply.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
