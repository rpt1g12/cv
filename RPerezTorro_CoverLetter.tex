\opng{2} ``\job'' position in any of the slots available that has recently been posted on
\jobweb.\clng{2}

Ever since I left my home country I have been pursuing a career in motorsports. My first
step was to take a masters programme that gave me the specialisation and knowledge needed
to take a CFD position in a F1 team. During that course I gained experience in the
external aerodynamics of an open-wheel race car using CFD and wind tunnel tools. 

Later on I took a position in Southampton University where I have spent the last 3 years
as a researcher in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics which has given me an
extensive knowledge and expertise in the matter. On top of that, researching not only has
strengthened my background but also my creativity and scientific capabilities. I am now
a person that is capable of dealing with complex problems that need imaginative and
innovative solutions.

Additionally, as you can see in my CV, I also have experience in CAD surface modelling
acquired through several projects. Amongst them I would like to highlight my work in the
design of the Shell Eco-Marathon solar car, which you can see in my Linkedin profile
(\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}).

Finally, I would like to emphasise that you can expect from me someone that will be an
active asset for the team and will try to learn the most out of this
unique experience from first to last day.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me at any time
if you need any more details. I am looking forward to your reply.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
