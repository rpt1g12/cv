Dear Sir or Madame,

I have recently seen advertised on your website an open position for a Thermal
Systems Aero/CFD Engineer for which I feel I have the appropriate set of
skills.

I really admire the work of Tesla Motors and its view of future automotive
technology. On top of this, the position described has the perfect combination
of skills I have been looking for a job for years. After 3 years experience in
research I have acquired a solid base of knowledge in the field of CFD.
However, I feel I miss those days in university when in collaborative projects
I had to also be involved in the design/CAD-modelling stage. I would hence
definitely enjoy a multidisciplinary environment in which interaction with
other design departments was day to day thing.  

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me if
you need any more details.

Yours Faithfully,
Rafael Perez
