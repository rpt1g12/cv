%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing this letter in response to the ``CFD Engineer'' job advert on Sahara Force
India's website for which I believe I have the appropriate set of skills. 

I am currently finishing (this November) a PhD on the topic of Large-Eddy-Simulations of
wings with leading-edge modifications, and I am looking to take this further on my next
career challenge. After finishing my MSc in Race Car Aerodynamics I felt myself prepared to take
on a position such as the one now in consideration. However, after three years in the
research field, not only have I enhanced my previous skills but also acquired new
ones. A side from enhancing my knowledge, the PhD has made me more independent, being able
to quickly find solutions to specific problems. All in all, research has expanded my
knowledge and expertise to such an extent that I am able to meet expectations to a higher
degree and fight for each millisecond in each lap.

Additionally, although the research experience has been very rewarding, I feel that due to
my competitive character, I would much rather continue developing my career in the
fast-paced and team-based working environment of a F1 team.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me, or visit my
linkedin profile (\href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt}{uk.linkedin.com/in/rperezt})
if you need any more details.

Yours Faithfully, \newline % Closing text
