I have recently seen advertised on your website an open position for an application
engineer for which I feel I have the appropriate set of skills.

I have had the pleasure of speaking personally with your colleague Dr~Joe~Amodeo in the
summer of 2013 for the very same job offer. I recall getting a very good
impression from the company but unfortunately our paths diverged and I finally took a PhD
position in Southampton University.

At the time I considered myself prepared for the job but, after 3 years experience in
research I have acquired a solid base of knowledge in the field of CFD and I am more
confident that I can successfully fill this position. Additionally I have developed a
excellent customer-care skills through assisting students with their individual CFD
projects for the past 3 years which I feel would be really beneficial in this position.

Finally, I believe I could create a sense of confidence among potential customers
as I feel I am a very friendly and approachable person.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me if you need
any more details.
