I have recently seen your company has advertised an open position for an application
engineer for which I feel I have the appropriate set of skills.

I have had the pleasure of interacting personally with your company a couple of times in
the past while studying an MSc in Race Car Aerodynamics at Southampton University and always
thought it would be really nice to be part of CD-adapco. Consequently I have always been
checking any openings for your offices in Hammersmith.

I believe that after 3 years experience in research based I have acquired a solid base of
knowledge in the field of CFD. Additionally I am an experienced user of Star-CCM+ since I
have been helping students with their individual CFD projects for the past 3 years which
would be really useful for the position.

Finally, I believe I could create a sense of confidence among potential customers
as I feel I am a very friendly and approachable person.

Thank you for your time and consideration and please feel free to contact me if you need
any more details.
