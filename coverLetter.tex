%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have recently seen your company has advertised an open position for a Research \&
Development engineer for which I feel I would be a perfect fit.

I have spent some time researching about Next Limit and in particular about XFlow
and Real Flow. I must say that although my experience is build on more traditional CFD
approaches I am very interested in the Lattice Boltzmann technique. In fact I recently
started a personal project for coding my own LB code in Python in my spare time. As you can
see in my CV, I have a deep understanding of flow physics gained throw my bachelors,
master and doctoral studies. I have proven my value in the research field during my PhD in
Southampton University and have at the moment one paper pending on review for the
prestigious Journal of Fluid Mechanics scientific journal.

In addition to my experience, I have a passion for programming and post-processing, something
that seems to be important for the position advertised and that I would be more than
pleased to bring into the Next Level team.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet you either face to face or via
video-conference. I am currently based in UK but please feel free to contact me by
either phone or email to arrange a meeting at your convenience. Thank you for
your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
